# Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals Training

This repository documents my learnings and proof-of-work from attending **Microsoft‚Äôs Virtual Training Day on Security, Compliance, and Identity (SCI) Fundamentals**, delivered by Microsoft Technical Trainer **Sarah Allali**.

The training strengthened my knowledge of **cloud security models, Zero Trust, encryption, identity management, compliance frameworks, and Microsoft security tools** like Sentinel, Defender for Cloud, and Security Copilot.

## üîë Key Takeaways

- **Shared Responsibility Model** clarifies roles between provider vs. customer across SaaS, PaaS, IaaS.  
- **Defense in Depth** ensures multiple security layers (physical, identity, network, application, data).  
- **Zero Trust** = verify explicitly, least privilege, assume breach across six pillars.  
- **Encryption & Hashing** protect confidentiality and integrity (AES, RSA, salted hashing).  
- **GRC Frameworks** like GDPR, PCI-DSS, SOC 2 ensure compliance and continuous risk assessment.  
- **Identity as Perimeter** ‚Üí Entra ID, MFA, conditional access policies.  
- **Microsoft Tools** (Defender, Sentinel, Purview, Security Copilot) provide enterprise-grade security monitoring and compliance.

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Apply SCI knowledge to **SOC analyst scenarios** (log monitoring, conditional access testing).  
- Build **hands-on labs** with Azure Sentinel & Defender.  
- Continue documenting learnings for portfolio growth.
